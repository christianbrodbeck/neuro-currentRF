"""The solver contract.

A solver is immutable configuration that estimates NCRF weights (:meth:`Solver.solve`).
A solver that has more than one configuration to choose from selects one in
:meth:`Solver.search`, calling ``crossvalidate`` as often as it needs to. That
one hook owns the whole search, so a solver can score a fixed grid, extend it,
or refine it in several passes without the estimator knowing anything about it.

:meth:`SolverFit.score` contributes solver-specific scores to compare
configurations by. Every hook has a working default, so a new solver only needs
:meth:`solve`.
