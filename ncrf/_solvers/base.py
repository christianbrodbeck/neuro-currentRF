"""The solver contract.

A solver is immutable configuration that estimates NCRF weights (:meth:`Solver.solve`).
A solver that has more than one configuration to choose from selects one in
:meth:`Solver.search`, which is handed a callable that cross-validates
configurations on demand. That one hook owns the whole search, so a solver can
score a fixed grid, extend it, or refine it in several passes without the
estimator or the cross-validation machinery knowing anything about it.

:meth:`SolverFit.score` contributes solver-specific scores to compare
configurations by. Every hook has a working default, so a new solver only needs
:meth:`solve`.
