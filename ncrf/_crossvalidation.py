    always comes before the held-out data. Successive splits move the validation
    window forward in time and thus train on progressively more data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r
        Size of each validation window relative to the samples left for

        start of the validation window. Set it to the TRF length so that lagged
        predictors in the training data do not reach into the held-out window.
