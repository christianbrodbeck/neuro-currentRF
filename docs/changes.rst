Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- **Free-orientation fits used a broken convergence check.** A bug in
  the group sparsity penalty pinned one of the inner solver's two convergence
  measures at a constant value, so the inner iterations could only ever stop on
  the other one. TRF estimates from free-orientation source spaces therefore
  change; fixed-orientation fits are unaffected.
- **Source-wise explained variance was wrong for data with more than one
  segment.** :meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.voxelwise_explained_variance` reused one ``theta``
  scratch buffer across segments without resetting it, so from the second segment
  on the baseline residual was computed with the last source's weights still
  zeroed, corrupting every per-source value.
- **``use_ES=True`` depended on the order in which workers returned.** The guard
  for "the cross-fit winner is already the largest ``mu``" compared it with the
  last element of the unordered result list instead of the largest ``mu``, so
  estimation-stability refinement was skipped or applied inconsistently from run
  to run. Selection is now order-independent, and the ``mu`` grid is extended
  before the criterion is applied, so it sees the complete search range.
- **:attr:`ncrf.NCRF.h_scaled` undid the covariate scaling in the wrong
  direction.** The covariates are divided by the scale, so restoring stimulus
  units requires dividing ``h`` by it as well, but ``h_scaled`` multiplied
  instead. Values obtained with ``normalize='l1'`` or ``normalize='l2'`` were
  therefore off by the square of the scale factor.
- **Data whose sensors do not match the lead field is now rejected.** The
  whitening filter and the lead field are indexed by channel position, so data
  with the same channels in a different order was silently attributed to the
  wrong channels. :func:`~ncrf.fit_ncrf` aligned the lead field itself, but the
  component API did not.

Major API changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fitting and the fitted model
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fitting is separated into a reusable fitted model, an estimator that owns the
forward model, and a pluggable optimization algorithm (see :doc:`architecture`).

- :func:`~ncrf.fit_ncrf` returns an :class:`~ncrf.NCRFFit` report rather than a
  fitted :class:`~ncrf.NCRF`. The reusable model is :attr:`~ncrf.NCRFFit.model`.
- :class:`~ncrf.NCRF` is now the fitted model: coefficients, forward state and
  design, with :meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.predict`, :meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.evaluate` and
  :meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.voxelwise_explained_variance`. Fitting moved to
  :class:`~ncrf.NCRFEstimator`, which is constructed with the lead field and
  noise covariance. Code doing ``NCRF(lead_field, noise_covariance).fit(data)``
  becomes ``NCRFEstimator(lead_field, noise_covariance).fit(data, solver)``.
- The optimization algorithm is a :class:`~ncrf.Solver`, configured
  independently of the data and the forward model.
  :class:`~ncrf.ChampLasso` implements the published algorithm and carries
  ``mu``, the iteration counts, ``tol`` and ``use_es``. It also owns the
  ``mu`` search, so ``n_iter``, ``n_iterc``, ``n_iterf``, ``tol``, ``mu`` and
  ``use_ES`` on :func:`~ncrf.fit_ncrf` are ignored when a ``solver`` is passed.
- Cross-validation folds are configured with :class:`~ncrf.CrossValidation`, and
  each candidate's held-out scores are returned as :class:`~ncrf.CVResult`.
- The model metadata that used to live on the fitted object is now a
  :class:`~ncrf.TRFDesign`, and the forward state a :class:`~ncrf.ForwardModel`.

Attributes of the old fitted model map onto the fit report as follows:

Because the fitted object was restructured, models pickled with earlier versions
can no longer be loaded.

Applying a model to new data
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A fitted :class:`~ncrf.NCRF` can be applied to any compatible dataset:
:meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.predict` returns predictions in the units of the M/EEG data,
and :meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.evaluate` scores them in whitened sensor space with one or
more metrics (:func:`~ncrf.explained_variance`, :func:`~ncrf.l2_error`, or a
custom one). The new data has to carry the training data's normalization; prepare
it with ``scale=None`` and apply :meth:`~ncrf.RegressionData.normalize` with the
model's ``design`` (see :doc:`guide`).

Normalization
"""""""""""""

Normalization is now owned by :class:`~ncrf.RegressionData` and checked when a
fitted model is applied to new data (see :doc:`guide`).

- :func:`~ncrf.fit_ncrf` and :meth:`~ncrf.RegressionData.from_data` take a single
  ``scale`` argument instead of ``normalize`` and
  ``do_post_normalization``/``post_normalize``, which were not independent
  (post-normalization cancelled out ``'l1'``/``'l2'`` scaling):

  ====================  ==========================  ==================================
  ``normalize``         ``do_post_normalization``    now
  ====================  ==========================  ==================================
  ``False`` (default)   ``True`` (default)          ``scale='spectral'`` (default)
  ``'l1'``/``'l2'``     ``True``                    ``scale='spectral'``
  ``'l1'``/``'l2'``     ``False``                   ``scale='l1'``/``'l2'``
  ``False``             ``False``                   ``scale=None``
  ====================  ==========================  ==================================

- Every ``scale`` also subtracts each predictor's mean. Previously the mean was only
  subtracted with ``normalize``, so the default fit scaled the covariates without
  centering the predictors; it now centers them.
- Normalization is applied to the covariates rather than to ``stim``, which is
  never modified; ``in_place`` now only concerns ``meg``.
- :attr:`ncrf.NCRF.h_scaled` now also undoes spectral scaling; previously ``h``
  from a post-normalized fit was not in stimulus units. (The direction of the
  correction was also wrong; see `Bug fixes`_.)
- Spectral scaling is now also applied to data with a single covariate channel,
  which changes the scale of ``h`` (but not of ``h_scaled``) for such fits. Since
  ``mu`` regularizes coefficients on the covariate scale, values tuned before this
  change are not comparable for those fits.
- The ``'spectral'`` norm is measured on centered covariates, so its value differs
  slightly from the post-normalization factor of earlier versions.
