The simplest entry point is :func:`ncrf.fit_ncrf`, which accepts Eelbrain
:class:`~eelbrain.NDVar` objects, prepares the regression design, selects a
regularization value when needed, and returns a structured fit report::

    from ncrf import fit_ncrf

    result = fit_ncrf(
        meg,
        stim,
        lead_field,
        noise,
        mu="auto",
        tstop=1.0,
        n_splits=3,
    )
    trf = result.model.h
    training_scores = result.scores

The fitted :class:`~ncrf.NCRF` in ``result.model`` is independent of the
optimizer that produced it. It can predict or evaluate another compatible
:class:`~ncrf.RegressionData` dataset. Optimization diagnostics remain in
``result.solver_fit``, and cross-validation results can be inspected with
:meth:`~ncrf.NCRFFit.cv_info`.


Normalization
-------------

The covariates that an NCRF is fit against can be centered and scaled.
:class:`~ncrf.RegressionData` handles this normalization: it computes the
values, applies them to the covariates, and records them on its ``design``.

:meth:`~ncrf.RegressionData.from_data` and :func:`~ncrf.fit_ncrf` take one
``scale`` argument. Each predictor's mean is subtracted, and each covariate
channel is divided by one factor:

- ``'spectral'`` (the default): the average spectral norm of the channel's
  covariates. This equalizes covariate scales across predictor variables, so that
  one regularization parameter is appropriate for all of them.
- ``'l1'``/``'l2'``: the predictor's mean absolute deviation or standard
  deviation.
- ``None``: leave the covariates on their raw scale, without centering.

The centering and the ``'l1'``/``'l2'`` factors are properties of the predictor,
and are measured on all of its samples. The ``'spectral'`` norm is a property of
the covariates that were built from it, and is measured on the rows that carry a
complete lag window.

Centering and scaling are a single choice because they only make sense together.
M/EEG data is high-pass filtered, so an uncentered predictor's mean would
contribute a constant ``mean * sum(h)`` to the prediction, which the fit has to
reconcile with zero-mean data -- in effect constraining the response function to
sum to zero. And the scale factors measure variation around the mean rather than
raw magnitude, since a predictor's offset would otherwise dominate its scale and
leave its variation over-regularized.

:attr:`~ncrf.NCRF.h` is in units of the normalized covariates.
:attr:`~ncrf.NCRF.h_scaled` restores the original stimulus scale,
and is the appropriate representation for comparing response
functions across predictors or across models.

Applying a model to new data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A fitted model can only be applied to covariates on the scale it was fit on --
multiplying coefficients learned from ``(stim - baseline) / scaling`` with a raw
stimulus would silently produce wrong predictions and scores. New data therefore
has to carry the same normalization as the training data. Prepare it
unnormalized and apply the model's own normalization with
:meth:`~ncrf.RegressionData.normalize`::

    test_data = RegressionData.from_data(
        [test_meg],
        [[test_stim]],
        tstart=0.0,
        tstop=1.0,
        stim_is_single=True,
        scale=None,
    )
    test_data = test_data.normalize(result.model.design)
    scores = result.model.evaluate(test_data)

Note that this uses the training data's normalization values, which is what
makes the scores comparable; re-deriving them from the test data would put the
covariates on a different scale.

:meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.predict`, :meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.evaluate` and
:meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.voxelwise_explained_variance` raise an error when ``data``
carries a different normalization, or when its design describes different
predictors, TRF timings, or a different basis. Normalizing data that is already
normalized is a no-op when the values agree, and an error otherwise, so a dataset
can safely be passed to :meth:`~ncrf.RegressionData.normalize` more than once.

Prediction units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.predict` returns predictions in the units of the M/EEG data the
dataset was built from, so they can be compared with the original recording
directly.

:meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.evaluate` instead scores in *whitened* sensor space, where the
noise covariance is the identity and channels are therefore comparable. This is
the space the solver optimizes in and the one cross-validation compares
candidates in, which is what makes ``result.scores`` and the cross-validation
scores commensurable. Pass ``whitened=True`` to :meth:`~ncrf.NCRF.predict` to see
the predictions the metrics are computed on.
